### Threat Trends
Fintech represents [19% of total attacks](https://finadium.com/ibm-cyber-report-shows-cryptojacking-growing-threat-to-finance/) and incidents and continues to be the most targeted industry.


**Ransomware**
Type of malware that infects a device and prevents user from accessing certain files by either locking database or encrypting files unless a ransom is paid.</p>

- Travelex company was attacked by Sodinokibi Ransomware in 2020 by a group known as Evil.
- It took [Travelex a month](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-travelex/travelex-says-uk-money-transfer-and-wire-services-back-online-after-hack-idUSKBN1ZR1S5) to get its money transfer systems back online.

**Phishing**
Cyberthreat wherein malicious actors use fraudulent messages to lure users and employees into disclosing personal and sensitive information.
- Used to gain a foothold in a network by compromising an employee to gain privileged access to secured data.
- [43% of the employees](https://www.harbortg.com/blog/hybrid-work-makes-businesses-more-vulnerable-to-cybercriminals#:~:text=43%25%20of%20employees%20have%20made,more%20error%2Dprone%20when%20tired) say they have made mistakes compromising the company’s cybersecurity.
- [27% of the phishing incidents](https://finadium.com/ibm-cyber-report-shows-cryptojacking-growing-threat-to-finance/) note that attackers target users of web mail services.

**Cross-Site Scripting**
XSS attacks inject malicious content into trusted website to gain access to cookies and sensitive information. Types are Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM XSS.
- The most widely used attack method to breach large companies in 2019.
- Used in [39% of cyber incidents](https://www.wpexplorer.com/cross-site-scripting-wordpress/) as per reports.

**CryproJacking**
Cryptomining malware (or [cryptojacking](https://finadium.com/ibm-cyber-report-shows-cryptojacking-growing-threat-to-finance/)) is hidden software that infects victims’ devices with JavaScript code, harnessing their processing power to mine cryptocurrencies and thus generating revenue.
Cryptojacking is a relatively new phenomenon, driven by the rising price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
- Driven by the rising prices of cryptocurrencies.
- Malware (hidden software) that harnesses victim's hardware to mine cryptocurrency.
- Cryptominers have [infected 10 times more organizations than ransomware](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/hidden-miners-botnet-threat/18488/) in 2018.
- A single cryptocurrency mining botnet can net cyber criminals more than [$30,000 per month](https://triagingx.com/blogs/view/txhunter-detects-cryptocurrency-malware).

1. Threat actor compromises site.
2. User visits compromised site.
3. End-user unknowingly starts mining cryptocurrency.
4. Actor receives cryptocurrency reward.

## Threat Modeling
### Critical Asset Identification

**Personal & Financial Information**
This information entails highly confidential and sensitive client information such as social security numbers, home addresses, names, banking account details, etc. Banking institutions utilize this data for purposes such as marketing products and services, background checks to ensure an institution is conducting business with ethical clientele, and credit checks which help determine if an individual is credit worthy. If this information were to land in the wrong hands, then institutions potentially face heavy financial penalties in lawsuits, loss of clientele and most importantly a tarnished reputation and lack of trust from clients which can take decades to rebuild.

**Financial Transaction Data**
Financial transaction data is likely the most important asset any financial institution can own. Banks rely on this data to account for where, when and how much money changed hands for goods or services consumed. This data ensures that institutions maintain both ethical and integral accounting practices for consumer protection purposes. Institutions also use this data to derive insight on clientele with hopes of offering profitable customized services. In the event of a data breach, any data tempered with would likely result in a loss of data integrity which presents severe consequences for both merchant and consumer as the data is no longer credible.

**Intellectual Property**
Intellectual property, more specifically trade secrets, are a crucial part of any large organization’s success. This can comprise of ideas, patents, products, services, etc. that an organization safeguards, as these are usually what allows them to gain a competitive advantage in the market. This asset can potentially make or break an organizations success in the future, and the Fintech industry is no exception, so it is vital to protect it at all costs. If intellectual property is leaked or sold to competitors as a result of a breach, then it can be used against an institution in plentiful ways that can have long term effects, or in severe cases affect the overall existence of an institution.

**Financial Business Systems & Application**
Business Systems/Applications are the platforms which institutions rely on to conduct business. These systems comprise of storage servers, general ledgers, portfolio reporting and reconciliation systems, etc. More importantly, these are also the applications that clients use to complete day-to-day financial transactions such as payments, money wire transfers, reviewing loan and bank account balances. A breach of such critical systems can have major consequences, such as losing the ability to operate completely which can have a major effect on revenue for an institution, even for a few hours. Clients could be affected to the extent of not being able to pay for goods or services which can be problematic.

**Financial Banking Networks**
An enterprise network can be regarded as the veins of any organization, as it enables both integration and information flow across different systems. These networks also responsible for allowing clients to interact with an institution’s financial applications such as mobile banking apps. In addition, institutions that offer services which rely on integrations with external systems, such as stock trading, require system networks to make this all possible. It is evident that banking networks are a vital component of any institution, and so a breach of these networks can have tremendous consequences depending on the severity of the breach. An institution could be left crippled if a network is completely  brought down, data can be stolen through a network breach, etc., so it is imperative that organizations maintain a secure network at any given point in time.

- Stratosphere IPS​ data is accessible as one zip file containing all the RATs together, with log, pcap and zeek log files. Includes 8 packet captures from 8 executed Android RATs.

### Stratosphere IPS - Android Mischief Dataset
**Data Extraction Methodology followed by Stratosphere IPS**
- Installation - Searching for RAT code on the Internet, downloading it, installing an appropriate virtual machine for execution of the RAT’s controller, including all the library requirements on the virtual machine (e.g .NET Framework, JRE), and finally preparing the physical phone or phone virtual emulator as a victim to infect.
- Execution - First, use the Builder app in the Windows VM to create and build a new APK file. Second, start the RAT Controller in the Windows VM so it is ready to receive victims. Third, send the APK to the phone
- Traffic Capture - When performing actions in the controller and the server, capture the network traffic using own VPN server, or in the case of an Android virtual emulator, use the computer network interface.
- Dataset Logging - When performing actions in the client and the server, write a log file of the performed actions and take screenshots for each action in the Controller and the phone.  As a result, each RAT in the dataset includes an APK file, a log file, screenshots files, a pcap file, and a README.md.
